# Personal_AI_interface

This is a simple interface for an AI chat bot, with the option of saving configurations to use in the chat. It's developed mostly for experimentation and research, and is in it's current state only designed to be run locally on a computer with a local database. Also, for now only working with OpenAIs GPT3.5-turbo. 

I'm not a developer! This is crude, simple and no security measures have been taken with this so far. 

To be added: 
- Add configuration to chat history
- Add automatic summary of chat sessions.
- Add behaviour: Refer back to previous session upon starting a new session.
- Add support for otehr AI models.
